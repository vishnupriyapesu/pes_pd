> c or any other language converted in to assembly level language by complier then assembly in turn converted in to binary code which hardware can understand


> there are two main interface


1. instructions (also called architecture of computer)

2.assembler,which converts assembly level to binary code





**Example:clock**

### Introduction to all components of open-source digital asic design

**open source digital asic design**


![Screenshot (185)](https://github.com/vishnupriyapesu/pes_pd/assets/142419649/dbdd9025-835f-4ca5-8c54-b08c3c323585)



**Process Design Kit(PDK)**: 

> In the field of semiconductor manufacturing, a PDK is a set of files and data used by semiconductor designers to create and verify the physical layout of an integrated circuit (IC) on a silicon wafer.
> It includes information about the fabrication process, device models, and design rules


> PDK is the interface between fabrication and the designer


> google worked out an agreement with sky water the open source PDK for the 130nm process by skywater

> june 30 2020 google relewased first ever PDK open source

![Screenshot (186)](https://github.com/vishnupriyapesu/pes_pd/assets/142419649/b1174e08-aa59-4b6d-99e8-4e7b01beb6e9)


is 130nm fast?
yes it is ,
here are two examples:

### simplified ASIC design flow:

1. **synthesis**:
> coverts RTL to a circuit out of components from the standard cell library(SCL)

![Screenshot (190)](https://github.com/vishnupriyapesu/pes_pd/assets/142419649/767567d2-fcae-4695-b640-e8a096ca7893)

> standard cells,each cell has different views/models

--> Electrical, HDL,SPICE

--> Layout (Abstract and Detailed)


2. **floor /power planning**:


it depends on whether we are implementing the single component (MacroFloor planning)or whole chip(chip Floor planning)

macro Floor planning : Dimensions, pin locations,rows definition

![Screenshot (192)](https://github.com/vishnupriyapesu/pes_pd/assets/142419649/9917b9e9-f970-4233-b6ea-7462d67d0882)



chip Floor planning: partition the chip die between different system building blocks and place the I/O pads

![Screenshot (193)](https://github.com/vishnupriyapesu/pes_pd/assets/142419649/0cf29d23-1247-4fbf-9223-ea32c1d6fd4c)



3.**placement**

placements are done in tw steps:


--> global placemnts find optimal positions for old cells,cells may overlap

--> Detailed placements


4.**clocl tree synthesis**:

--> To deliver the clock to all sequential elements (e.g., FF) with minimum skew And in agood shape

-->Tree(H,X,...)


5. **routing**

--> implement the interconnect using the available metal layers

--> Metal tracks form a routing grid

--> Routing grid is huge 

--> Divide and Conquer


-- **Global Routin**g:Generates routing guides 


-- **Detailed Routing** : Uses the Routing guides to implement the actual wiring


6. **sign off**


--> **physical Verifications**

--Design rules Checking(DRC)


--Layout vs.Schematic(LVS)


-->**Timimg Verification**


--Static Timing Analysis



### Intoduction to openLANE and Strives chipsets

The problem is tougher when using Open source EDA


> Tools Qualificationa

> Tools Calibration

> Missing tools




**OpenLANE**

> Started as an Open Source Flow for a True Open Source Tape-out Experiment

> striVe is a family of Open everything SoCs

-- Open PDK, Open EDA,Open RTL


striVes has different members :

1. striVe : Sky 130 SCL + Synthesized 1Kbytes SRAM

2. striVe 2 : Sky 130 SCL +  1Kbytes Open RAM block

3. striVe 2a : striVe 2 with a single chip core module

4. strive 3 : OSU SCL + Synthesized 1Kbytes SRAM

5. striVe 5 : Sky 130 SCL + 8 x 1 Kbytes openRAM banks

6. striVe 6 : striVe 2 with DFT


![Screenshot (195)](https://github.com/vishnupriyapesu/pes_pd/assets/142419649/2860f943-a999-467e-9d83-35c8c37ebb62)



> The main goal of OpenLANE is to produce NO LVS violations , NO DRC violations and timing violations



> OpenLANE Tuned for SkyWater 130n Open PDK

OpenLANE has two modes of operation:

-- Autonomous or interactive

-- DesignSpace Exploration: find the best set of flow configuration



> OpenLANE has more number of design examples there are 43 design with their best configuration


### Introduction to OpenLANE detailed ASIC design flow

![Screenshot (196)](https://github.com/vishnupriyapesu/pes_pd/assets/142419649/e3d53506-ef0e-4020-a950-33ae9aff0e95)


![Screenshot (197)](https://github.com/vishnupriyapesu/pes_pd/assets/142419649/ac9d7579-40e5-4c39-9efd-64748a9f175b)



**Design For Test(DFT)**

> Scan Insertion

> Automatic Test Pattern Generation(ATPG)

> Test Patterns Compaction

> Fault Coverage

> Fault Simultion



**Logic Equivalence Check(LEC)**:

This is done by using **yosys**



>  Every time the netlist is modified ,verification must be performed

- CTS modifies the netlist

- post placement  optimizations modifies the netlist



> LEC is ude3s to formally confirm that the function did not change after modifying the netlist



**Dealing with Antenna Rules Violations:**

>  When ametal wire segment is fabricated ,it can act as an antenna.

- Reactive ion etching causes charge to accumulate on the wire

- Transistore gates can be damaged during fabrication

so for this problem we have two solutions :



1.Bridging attaches ahigher layer intermediary (requires Router awareness)


2. Add antenna diode cell to leak away charges (Antenna diodes are provides by the SCL)

- Add a fake Antenna Diode next to every cell input after placement


- Run the Antenna checker (Magic) in the routed layout

- if the checker reports a Violation on tthe cell input pin,replace the Fake Diode cell bu a real one




**Static Timing Analysis :**

> RC Extraction : DEF2SPEF

> STA: openSTA (openROAD)

 ### openlane Directory structure 

Sky 130A is pdk variant
which has two sub directries 

1. lib.ref : all the processor specific files

we will be working on pdk variant called sky130_fd_sc_hd

- sky130  : is the process name 

- fd : skywater foundary

- sc : standard cell

- hd(high density) : variant of pdk

2. lib.tech :specific to the tool
